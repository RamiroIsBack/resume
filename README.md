This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

this is My resume done in ReactJs, clone or copy the repository if you want :) , it's pretty straight forward convention like structure and use of the frameWork.

It's all Java script, Css, ReactJs, React-Redux with Firebase as back-end/Database, some functions and components are tested with Jest using snapshots.  I also integrated react-google-maps.
