  "bio": "I've always been trying to work in what I enjoy, 
 I enjoy very much programming and that is what I've mostly done,creating mobile Apps, web apps on my own or collaborating in different projects.
I also enjoyed learning from various work fields and living in different countries what made me more versatile as a worker, increasing my skills.
Nowadays I live in Baltimore U.S.A. looking forward to continue my career as web-app developer here.
At the moment I'm finishing up an e-commerce web-app project for a client in Europe.
I'm very excited for new projects!",
